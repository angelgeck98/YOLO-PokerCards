Not really a to-do file but it's holding my thoughts and other things.

2.  Poker Hand Logic: The logic for classifying a poker hand is a fun problem. I recommend you represent the 
cards in a structured way as soon as they are detected. For example, a list of tuples like `[('K', 'Spades'), 
('K', 'Hearts'), ('7', 'Clubs'), ...]`. This will make it much easier to write functions to check for pairs, straights, 
flushes, etc.
3.  Confidence Threshold: Your YOLO model will return a confidence score for each detected card. You will need to set a 
threshold (e.g., 0.5) to filter out low-confidence detections. You should experiment with this threshold to see how it 
affects your hand classification accuracy.

ACTUAL TO-DO:
- train model with 100 epochs
- check if detection works with video input
- create logic for poker hands identification
- figure out how cards are represented once they're detected 
  - change this so that it's [rank, suit] tuple
- include anything in evaluation and helpers files??
