Not really a to-do file but it's holding my thoughts and other things.

Prof comments on our project:
[Recommendations]
1.  YOLO Fine-Tuning: The Ultralytics library is well-documented. Pay close attention to their tutorials 
on how to format your dataset correctly for training. Getting the dataset configuration (`.yaml` file) right 
is the most common stumbling block.
2.  Poker Hand Logic: The logic for classifying a poker hand is a fun problem. I recommend you represent the 
cards in a structured way as soon as they are detected. For example, a list of tuples like `[('K', 'Spades'), 
('K', 'Hearts'), ('7', 'Clubs'), ...]`. This will make it much easier to write functions to check for pairs, straights, 
flushes, etc.
3.  Confidence Threshold: Your YOLO model will return a confidence score for each detected card. You will need to set a 
threshold (e.g., 0.5) to filter out low-confidence detections. You should experiment with this threshold to see how it 
affects your hand classification accuracy.

ACTUAL TO-DO:
- make virutal environment and install dependencies
  - are those all the dependencies we need? do we need more? less?
- ermmmm do literally everything else
